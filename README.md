🌱 AI Models for Plant Health & Detection System

This project implements five distinct AI models built with TensorFlow and PyTorch to identify and analyze various plant-related conditions using deep learning. The models are designed to improve agricultural monitoring by detecting plant issues early and accurately.

🔍 What the models detect:

Plant Diseases – Identifies visible symptoms such as leaf spots, discoloration, and infections.

Soil Conditions – Classifies soil health indicators including moisture deficiency and nutrient imbalance.

Pests – Detects harmful insects and infestations affecting plant growth.

Flower Recognition – Classifies different types of flowers based on visual features.

🛠 Technologies Used:

TensorFlow – Training, evaluating, and deploying deep learning models.

PyTorch – Model experimentation and custom neural network implementations.

Pandas – Data preprocessing, cleaning, and management.

NumPy – Numerical computing and efficient array operations.

📈 Key Features:

Multiple independent models for specialized detection tasks.

Supports image-based classification and health analysis.

Modular design for easy extension and customization.

Dataset handling and preprocessing with Pandas and NumPy.

Trained using modern deep learning techniques for accuracy and performance.

🎯 Goal:

To provide an intelligent system that helps farmers, researchers, and developers detect plant problems early and improve agricultural decision-making using artificial intelligence.
